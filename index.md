I am a final-year PhD student in applied mathematics at the City University of Hong Kong. Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in
Statistical Learning Theory and Deep Learning methods for solving PDEs arising from the study of rare events phenomena. I like to exploit the 
mathematical structure of the problems I care about to design theoretically-principled solvers with provable guarantees.
