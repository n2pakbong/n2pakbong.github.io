I am a final-year PhD student in applied mathematics at the City University of Hong Kong. Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in **Statistical Learning Theory** and **Deep Learning methods for solving PDEs** arising from the study of rare events phenomena. I like to exploit the mathematical structure of the problems I care about to design theoretically‑principled solvers with provable guarantees.
